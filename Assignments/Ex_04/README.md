# Exercise 4

### MPI identity matrix

To reproduce the results in Ulysses, clone the Github repository and use the following command:

qsub -l -q reserved3 nodes=1:ppn=20,walltime=00:10:00 parallel_programming/Assignments/Ex_04/ex4.sh

A file .out will be produced in the folder Ex_04, with the output matrix and the time to solution.
